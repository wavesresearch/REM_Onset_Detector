# REM_Onset_Detector

Python code to detect the onset of the rapid eye movements (REM) from polysomnography (PSG) data.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries should be installed before running the code:

* mne-python (https://mne.tools/)
* samplerate (https://pypi.org/project/samplerate/)
* EDFlib (https://pypi.org/project/EDFlib-Python/)

# Usage

See the examples in REM_Onset_Detector/examples. The examples were made using Jupyter Notebook.

# Acknowledgments

The code was primarly written by Ole Drange while writing his master thesis at Department of Engineering Cybernetics of Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU.
